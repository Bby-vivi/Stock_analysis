# Stock_Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of the Poject 

### The Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to provide an efficient stock analysis for Steve's by using Excel VBA. As we went through the requirements for Steven and his parent we discover adequate data information. Based off the data information we brought to light the DAQO New Energy Corporation stock and other stock choices for Steve's parents. By gather DAQO and other stocks we were able to make the Excel VBA easy to understand, also providing the capability to add future data.

### The Background 
A key factor in this project was to provide a tool for Steve to use in assisting this parent and other clients with their stock marketing decisions. However, in order to make Excel VBA a strong tool, and to have the ability to gain more future data with efficiency I need to use a refactoring coding process. Initial this process was completed with a common formatting. Nevertheless, by refactoring the code I was able to accomplish our goal.

### Results
The original coding performed with no issues, although, the speed and efficiency was cause an issues that can hinder Steve’s goals. By utilizing the refactoring coding process I was able to provide a faster and productivity solutions. Based off the code below you can see the compound requirements.

As you can tell from the screenshots below. In the year 2017 we can see it was more successful than the year 2018. The return 2017 within almost all Tickers had a positive value. Well, except for one.

In addition, to seeing the different between 2017 and 2018 return value. We also, have the ability to review the speed factor between converting between the years. Before the refactoring coding process, the code would take minutes to change, now only seconds. A huge difference!

### Summary
There’re are many advantages with the refactoring code. The main noticeable points are the efficiency and accuracy. By adding those factors made this a powerful code. An easier and user friendly worksheet for all to use. 

The one disadvantage I could say, is the time spent on the refactoring the code. Re-working the coding and perfecting takes a large amount of time. However, perfection takes time and practice to accomplish those goals.
